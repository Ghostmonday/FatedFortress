# FATEDFORTRESS CONSOLIDATED NOTES

**Session Date:** February 10, 2026  
**Status:** Active Development - Pre-Launch Phase

---

## 📋 PROJECT OVERVIEW

### Name & Branding
- **Primary Name:** FatedFortress (internal/project name)
- **Public Brand:** EXPNET
- **Tagline:** "Build with people who actually ship"
- **Value Proposition:** Turn solo developers into elite, execution-driven teams

### Vision
AI-native collaboration platform addressing fundamental failures in modern collaboration:
- Replaces resumes with XP-based reputation
- Enables anonymous participation with system accountability
- Uses AI to match developers with projects
- Rewards verified contribution over self-promotion
- Implements trust decay (no status hoarding)

### Core Mantras
1. **"Nothing is permanent without continued signal"** - Trust requires ongoing contribution
2. **"Anonymity protects participants from people — not from the system"** - Privacy with accountability
