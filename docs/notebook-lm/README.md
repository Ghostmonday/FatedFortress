# NotebookLM Material

**Purpose:** Content exported from NotebookLM that informs platform design, AI evaluation, matching, and related decisions.

---

## What Goes Here

- NotebookLM exports (PDF, markdown, or copied content)
- Synthesized notes from sources you've uploaded
- Brainstorming that started in NotebookLM and should live in the repo
