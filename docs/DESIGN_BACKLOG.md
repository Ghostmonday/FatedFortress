# Design Backlog — What Needs to Be Figured Out

**Everything we're still designing before/during build.**

---

## Design Docs (In Progress)

| Doc | Focus | Status |
|-----|-------|--------|
| `AI_EVALUATION.md` | How AI evaluates contribution, patterns, matching | Open |
| `XP_TAXONOMY.md` | Axes, metrics, decay, verification | Open |
| `PHILOSOPHY_RECONSIDERED.md` | Mantras, principles, tensions | Reference |
| `notebook-lm/` | NotebookLM exports → feed into above | Add material |

## Elements to Figure Out

### AI & Intelligence
- [ ] AI evaluation pipeline (see `AI_EVALUATION.md`)
- [ ] Contribution quality assessment
- [ ] Pattern detection
- [ ] Project generation from patterns
- [ ] Matching algorithm
- [ ] Abuse detection

### XP & Reputation
- [ ] Axis taxonomy (see `XP_TAXONOMY.md`)
- [ ] XP calculation formula
- [ ] Decay schedule
- [ ] Verification rules
- [ ] ANON display ranges (Minimal/Moderate/etc.)
- [ ] "Leagues" — technical mapping or marketing only?

### Trust & Safety
- [ ] ANON override criteria
- [ ] Appeal process
- [ ] Recovery pathways
- [ ] Data retention limits

### Integration
- [ ] GitHub: what events, what attribution
- [ ] Other sources? (Design tools, Notion, etc.)

### Copy & Brand
- [ ] Headline: "Join the leagues" vs "What does your code say about you?"
- [ ] Brand: FatedFortress vs EXPNET for public

## Inputs We're Waiting On

- **NotebookLM material** — Add to `docs/notebook-lm/`

*Update as items get designed or deprioritized.*
