# FATEDFORTRESS (EXPNET)

**A community of builders who ship.**

*"Build with people who actually ship."*

---

## What This Is

FatedFortress (public brand: EXPNET) is an attempt to build something different. A platform where:

- **Your work speaks.** Self-reported skills mean nothing. Real contribution tells the truth.
- **Privacy is real.** You control when you're visible. No performance tax for being yourself.
- **Trust is earned, not hoarded.** What you do recently matters. We don't believe in permanent status.
- **Teams form around execution.** Not resumes. Not credentials. Verified contribution.

This is not a finished product. It's an experiment in what collaboration could be.

---

## The Problem We See

Modern collaboration platforms fail developers:

| Problem | What Happens Instead |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Visibility over contribution** | Platforms reward self-promotion. We reward actual work. |
| **Activity conflated with value** | High activity ≠ high value. We track what you ship. |
| **Forced self-promotion** | Credentials before participation. We let work precede visibility. |
| **Identity coercion** | Contribute without exposure. Privacy is a feature. |
| **Trust manipulation** | Escape reputation through identity changes. We track accountability. |
| **Coordination failure** | Talent exists but doesn't connect. We try to fix this. |

---

## What We Actually Deliver

We're honest about what this is:

| Feature | What It Is | What It Isn't |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| **XP-Based Reputation** | Experience points from verified contributions | A replacement for all reputation |
| **Visibility Modes** | ANON (pseudonymous) or OFF (visible) | Perfect anonymity |
| **AI Matching** | Algorithm proposes collaborators | Perfect team composition |
| **Trust Decay** | Recent contribution weights more | Punishment for life events |
| **Task System** | Clear scope, verified completion | All possible work captured |

**We are building this. It will evolve. We will make mistakes.**

## Core Philosophy

### What We Believe

1. **"Nothing is permanent without continued signal"**
   - Trust decays without ongoing contribution
   - But: sabbatical and life events are real
   - We are exploring ways to handle this humanly

2. **"Anonymity protects you from peers—not from adjudication"**
   - Privacy from other humans
   - Accountability to the system (for disputes, enforcement)
   - We cannot promise protection from all possible futures

### What We're Unsure About

The [`PHILOSOPHY_RECONSIDERED.md`](docs/PHILOSOPHY_RECONSIDERED.md) document contains our critical self-audit:

- **Telemetry limits.** We observe behavior, but not everything. Observable ≠ complete.
- **Verification is circular.** Who verifies the verifiers? We don't have perfect answers.
- **Matching is probabilistic.** Teams may fail for reasons no system captures.
- **Depth vs. breadth.** The system may favor frequent small contributions over deep work.
- **Recovery is hard.** Once trust decays, rebuilding requires opportunity.

**We're building this. We'll learn. We'll adapt.**

---

## The Adventuring Party Model (A Heuristic)

Teams need composition, not just skills. We think in terms of:

- **Architect** — Sees the system whole
- **Builder** — Translates design into code
- **Guardian** — Tests, reviews, protects quality
- **Navigator** — Coordinates, communicates, aligns
- **Mentor** — Elevates others, transfers knowledge
- **Patron** — Provides resources (opt-in, voluntary)

**This is a heuristic, not a rigid schema.** Real teams are messier. We use this as a guide, not a law.

---

## Ethical Boundaries

We explicitly refuse to:

- Enable surveillance of individuals
- Automate coercion or manipulation
- Undermine labor protections
- Centralize irreversible power
- Sell reputation manipulation capability

## User States

| State | What You Can Do |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Visitor** | Browse public listings |
| **Passive Member** | Browse AI projects, observe |
| **Active Member** | Submit work, earn XP, toggle visibility |
| **Project Member** | Project-scoped contribution |
| **Trusted Member** | Enhanced access, governance participation |

---

## XP Axes (Examples)

We track reputation across multiple dimensions:

**Technical:** Backend, Frontend, DevOps, Data, Security, Mobile
**Process:** Project Management, QA, Documentation
**Collaboration:** Technical Leadership, Cross-functional Coordination, Community Building
**Enablement:** Patronage, Mentorship, Evangelism

## Quick Start

### For Builders

1. **Read the philosophy.** Understand what we're attempting.
2. **Watch for launch.** Q2 2026 target.
3. **Join the waitlist.** Early access at [expnet.io] when live.

### For Contributors

1. **Read the docs.** [`docs/`](docs/) contains specifications and reasoning.
2. **Check the roadmap.** [`PROJECT_TRACKER.md`](PROJECT_TRACKER.md) has action items.
3. **Start small.** Issues and PRs welcome when code lands.

### For Skeptics

1. **Read PHILOSOPHY_RECONSIDERED.** We don't claim perfection.
2. **Ask questions.** Open issues if you have concerns.
3. **Help us improve.** Critical feedback makes this better.

## The Honest Truth

This is an experiment. We don't know if it will work. We're building in public, sharing our reasoning, and accepting that:

- Some assumptions may be wrong
- Some dependencies may not hold
- Some users may not find what they need

**But we're trying something different. Because the current state of developer collaboration isn't working for everyone.**
